# TEONN: Neural Network for Transport Equation Approximation

This project implements a fully-connected neural network to approximate physical profiles generated by ASTRA-based transport models in plasma physics.

## Features

- Neural network that learns from input parameters to generate 1D transport profiles
- Data preprocessing with normalization and padding
- Evaluation with regression metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE, RÂ², Pearson R
- Export of predictions to CSV format
